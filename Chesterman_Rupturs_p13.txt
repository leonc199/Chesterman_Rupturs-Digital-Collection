Of the Linnen Truſs, this first mentiond Truſs of Linnen  
is of very Little uſe, only for Children this Truſſ are  
exceeding tender and thereby altogether unfit to bear the Preſ-  
ſure of a Steel one, which is hardly poſsible to the make to fit

fit unſafy and pinch ’em in any part, might perhaps thereby  
endeavouring to Cure a Rupture lay a Foundation for a grow-  
ing Deformity, this Truſſ then is intended to aſsiſt in keeping  
up the Rupture and to ſecure or keep upon the Part at the  
same time ſome Neceſſary outward Application for promoting  
a Cure. This Truſſ muſt be made of ſoft Linnen Double according  
to this Figure here annex’d.

Little hole is obvious enough, if for a Girl you muſt take care  
alſo to preſerve room ſufficient for all neceſſary Diſcharges, which  
is eaſy to do, the Breadth and Length muſt be in Proportion  
to
