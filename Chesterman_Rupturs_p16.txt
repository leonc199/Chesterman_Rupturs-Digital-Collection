THIS Figure being as much of a Human Body as is  
Required to ſhew the parts affected by Rupture I ſhall in none  
of the ſubſequent Figures exhibit any more, only Repeating  
as need ſhall Require.  

AT looking upon the foregoing Figure upon the Groin  
on the Right marked with an Aſterism is a Protuberance at  
or near which place ſometimes heigher, and ſometimes lower  
it is that Ruptures generaly make their firſt appearance.  
from which if neglected it Deſcends 'till at laſt it falls into  
to Scrotum of a Man or to the lip of the Pudenda of a Woman  
when arriv’d at either of theſe laſt mentiond places it  
then is at it’s fartheſt but not at its worſt, this laſt  
mention’d will encreaſe if due care be not taken of it,  
by Good Truſſes lc which if had recourſe to at firſt may  
Probably ſucceed, but it is alſo needfull to aſſiſt them with  
inward applications of which hereafter.  

As it is impoſsible to fit any Cloth to a Perſon it  
a Tayler never ſee, ſo alſo it is as uncertain to make a  
Truſſ to fit a Perſon without ſeeing and exactly Meaſuring  
Him, and then fitting it to the Body with Great Care  
and exactneſs, theſe precautions Remembered and the fol-  
lowing Directions obſerv’d, it is almoſt impoſſible to fail  
of ſitting; indeed if Perſons will not allow of being Mea-  
ſurd, they muſt blame themſelves if a miſtake Happen.
