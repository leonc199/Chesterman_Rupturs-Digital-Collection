Hardening is performd an Excellent Springy may and it may the  
better be turnd about to the Exact form of the Iron Plate yt

Plate to ſet the Steel one by to Render the Steel more Strong  
& yet more eaſy lay the edge upon the Stake that You ham-  
mer it upon and hammer it to turn the Edges of from the Body  
by which the Edges are prevented galling and the Strength of  
the Spring much encreas’d, You muſt always Remember that  
Hammering of the Steel makes it both broader and longer and

of the Back. I ſhall now give you the form of the Plate with y  
of the holes, catches &c.
