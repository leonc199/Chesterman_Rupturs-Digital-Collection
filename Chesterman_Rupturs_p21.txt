This is to be fixt on to the plate and then holding the Plate  
in one hand and the handle of the Inſtrument Fig. 7. in the  
other hand You may with eaſe turn the plate any way.  

THE. ſpring being Hammered and the two Catches fixed  
the Back part being Hammered a little hollow for the Eges  
to turn of from the Body, but not ſomuch as to cut the out-  
ſide covering in the wearing it what now Remains to do  
is to cover it.  

TAKE a Peice of fine, ſound, ſoft Cork about an Inch  
thick and Cut it to the for of the lower part of the Plate  
that lays upon the Rupture, the Uſe of this fork is to  
make a Pad to lay next the Body and by the force of the  
ſpring to be preſsed ſo far into the breach as to keep up the  
Bowels and Support and keep them in their proper place, in do-  
ing this there is a large Portion of the weight of the In-  
teſtines reſts upon the Back where the preſsure of the ſpring  
being Reciprocal cannot avoid it, indeed the wafte Hard of  
Breeches preſsing upon the forepart helps to encreaſe the preſſure  
of the Truſſ againſt the Groin and thereby becomes very  
uſefull in abating the force of the at the back, but to  
return to further Direction about faſtening the Cork it muſt  
be ſhaved Rounding of from the Edges to  
the ſides, or ſometimes a little more poin-  
ting in the midle as by theſe two ſide
figures the edge being next the life is ſhewn.
