Every Thing being in this forwardneſs wee now proceed  
to Covering it thus, take ſome fine thick wey ſoft woollin as  
Blanketting or the like, I Rekommend this as the only thing You  
can make uſe of that will lay even and be of an Equal  
thickneſs in all its parts which cannot be done with Wool  
or Cotton, Cut this woollin broader then the Steel ſpring, and  
with strong paſte such as Upholſterers uſe (which is made with  
flower & Roſin fix’d with water mixed into a Batter and well  
boiled) paſte the ſpring and ſoft over and lay on the wool-  
len preſsing it very cloſe, and form to it every where,  
a string may be wound round it that it may dry without  
the Woollen ſlying from its proper place, when it is Dry  
cut of all the woollen where it is more than one eighth part  
of an inch Broader then the Steel plate, this is left to  
Secure y Edge of the Steel from wearing through the Leather  
or from Chaſing or galling the Perſon in y Uſe of it, the next  
is the putting on the Leather which is beſt done Oil leather as  
Doe skin or Good old Sheep such as is called waſh leather, this  
leather muſt be cut broad enough to be turnd over the Edges  
of the Truſs to the outſide where the leather muſt be paſted down  
to the Steel and another piece of leather laid upon the outſide  
and then neatly ſtitched round between the Edges of the Steel &  
the outmoſt part of the leather, which now is to be faſtened to  
A Strap of Leather to reach from the back round the Body to the  
Catch.
