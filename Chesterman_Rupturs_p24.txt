THIS Figure  
here Exhibited do  
ſufficiently ſhew

new invented Truſs  
of mine and with  
what eaſe and  
Safety it may be  
worn, by either ſex

the Hip it cannot  
Slip down or fall  
off as a Woman yt  
wore one of the  
other ſort which  
Shall hereafter be

of fear when ſhe walked out leaſt it ſhould fall off, but upon  
puting on one of this ſort ſhe ſaid ſhe found that it might  
be worn with eaſe and Safety and without fear of looſing  
it or Diſturbing her misfortune. I Shall next ſhew how in  
caſe of a large Rupture to Confine it yet Cloſer and more ſecure-  
ly without hindring the eaſy motion of the Limbs in Walking.
