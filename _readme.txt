From the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s digitized copy of Ruptures, their various kinds, causes, and cure, I chose to record metadata on the page number, whether a figure was present on the page, and the section of the book that the page was in. Page Numbers and an identifier provide a base for someone looking at the text, allowing them to orient themselves and read the book as the author intended. This medical book features many elaborate hand-drawn figures, which are important to highlight and give a great summary of what the author is describing. These images also help identify how treatment and medical devices have changed. Finally, the book is split up into distinct sections, which the author separates with elaborate section titles written in a different and much larger text than the normal text. This again helps the reader be oriented, but also gives a summary of the manuscript without much in-depth reading.
