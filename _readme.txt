From the University of Pennsylvania’s digitized copy of Ruptures, their various kinds, causes, and cure, I chose to record metadata on the page number, whether a figure was present on the page, and the section of the book that the page was in. Page Numbers and an identifier provide a base for someone looking at the text, allowing them to orient themselves and read the book as the author intended. This medical book features many elaborate hand-drawn figures, which are important to highlight and give a great summary of what the author is describing. These images also help identify how treatment and medical devices have changed. Finally, the book is split up into distinct sections, which the author separates with elaborate section titles written in a different and much larger text than the normal text. This again helps the reader be oriented, but also gives a summary of the manuscript without much in-depth reading.

I used ChatGPT to HTR this text. Overall, Chat was quite accurate with the transcription. In the beginning, I gave it strict prompts: to not change or normalize any of the text, to transcribe everything on the page including the page number and the figure annotations, and also to retain and follow any old English styles that were used in the text. This last requirement is included because there is a large presence of ſ in the text, which is referred to as the long s which was used in the past. Despite the overall accuracy, Chat continually made key issues where I wasn't able to teach the model to change. One of them was replacing random words with similar counterparts. For example, on Page 13, Chat transcribed the word child to the word kid. This was quite prevalent; the model had confusions between words like scrotum and groin, patch and docket, holding and taking, and more. In addition, ChatGPT also seemed to overutilize the letter ſ, even when the text clearly displayed the modern letter s. This seemed to accompany the common trend of Chat attempting to match the text to the time it was written, and not directly just transcribing what was on the page. In essence, the model was too smart in a way, trying to predict and guess how the text would be written giving the circumstances and times of the writer. I also found this present when there were words that were scribbled out and indistinguishable, where it was impossible to decipher what the author had previously written. In these circumstances, ChatGPT would replace it with a word that fit the words around it, essentially guessing what was behind the scribble. With media like images and figures, I included both the figure number and the annotations. I included these texts directly before the sections where they were talked about, which the author made clear.
